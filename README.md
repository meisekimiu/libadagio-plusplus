![Unit Test Status](https://github.com/meisekimiu/libadagio-plusplus/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

This is a WIP 2D game engine I'm working on. The main focus of this engine is to make it easy to switch between
underlying libraries without changing any code besides some humble adapter classes.

This engine is still in a very WIP state. To get it working, make sure that git submodules are properly fetched by
running:

```shell
git submodule update
```
